                    Curiously, has no good color vision. However,
                    they can see pretty fast any color change, and
                    identify them at the same time as well.

                    The mantis shrimp can punch with the speed of 
                    a .22 caliber bullet—strong enough to break 
                    the shells of its prey, as well as aquarium 
                    glass.

                <li>
                    When a mantis shrimp hits its target, the 
                    velocity causes water to vaporize, then 
                    implode with a sharp bang, extremely high 
                    heat, and a flash of light—all of which is 
                    felt by the prey animal as an additional 
                    blow. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Some species of mantis shrimp wield spear 
                    like limbs that can impale their targets, 
                    instead of club-like limbs for bashing them.

                    When the striking limb of a mantis shrimp 
                    is not in use, it lies folded under the 
                    animal’s body, compressing a saddle-shaped 
                    spring that drives the animals stupendous 
                    strikes.

            <h2>A Strange Vision</h2>
            <section>
                <h3>Has Sixteen Color Receptors</h3>
                <img src="https://www.science.org/cms/10.1126/science.1245824/asset/da81bc83-de5b-4a5d-8f66-66561c2a3474/assets/graphic/343_411_f1.jpeg"
                    alt="Color receptors of mantis shrimp graphic">
                <p>
                    Researchers have long known that the mantis shrimp eye contains 12 color receptors, 
                    but they had no idea why. Humans and most other animals use three color-receptors 
                    to see the spectrum of light. In these animals, each of the three receptors gets 
                    excited by a different hue: red, green or blue light. The eye sends the signals from 
                    the receptors to the brain, which weighs the ratio of excitation of each receptor and 
                    perceives color based on those ratios.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>They see no more colors than other animals</h3>
                <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eGuZifKr0h4/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Image of a mantis shrimp's eyes">
                <p>
                    As it turned out, the shrimp could differentiate wavelengths that were about 25 nanometers 
                    apart, essentially the difference that separates orange and yellow. In comparison, humans 
                    can discriminate shades that are as little as 1 nanometer to 4 nanometers apart.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So why keep the 12-receptor system? Marshall and his colleagues aren't sure how it 
                    works yet, but they suspect the shrimps process color very quickly by setting up 
                    patterns of receptor excitation that correspond to certain colors. Imagine, for 
                    example, that every receptor is an empty bucket. If a couple of buckets on one 
                    end of the spectrum appear full, the shrimp knows it's seeing red. On the other 
                    end of the spectrum, the buckets represent blue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In other words, mantis shrimp might not so much process colors in the brain as 
                    recognize them in the eye, a technique that could help the animals quickly 
                    pick out colors in their brilliant reef environment.

            <h2>A Powerful Punch</h2>
            <section>
                <h3>Agressive Fighter</h3>
                <img src="https://compote.slate.com/images/c6f8da13-8e5f-4966-8274-21d903b501fc.jpg" alt="Two mantis shrimps fighting">
                <p>
                    It is a highly aggressive, territorial creature and doesn't take kindly to strangers 
                    invading the nooks and crevices that it calls home. Folded away beneath its body – 
                    much in the way that terrestrial praying mantises tuck their limbs beneath them – 
                    is a pair of lethal, club-like front legs, or "dactyls". 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, their potent attack armoury allows these crustaceans to prey on animals larger 
                    than themselves. Molluscs, crabs, shrimp and even other mantis shrimps are among their 
                    typical fare.

                <h3>Claws and Speed</h3>
                <img src="http://ourmarinespecies.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mantis_shrimps_4.jpg" alt="Ilustration of mantis shrimps claws">
                <p>
                    If threatened, the peacock mantis shrimp can whip out these appendages at speeds of 23 
                    m/sec (75 ft/sec). That's 50 times faster than the blink of an eye, or about the same 
                    as the trajectory of a .22 calibre bullet – and with a force some 100 times that of its 
                    weight, making it the strongest self-powered strike by an animal. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    So rapid is the uncoiling of their deadly limbs that it generates vapour-filled bubbles 
                    between the limb and the animal it is about to hit. That effectively doubles the impact 
                    of the strike: after the club makes contact with its target, the bubbles collapse and 
                    unleash a shock wave that may stun or kill the prey (sometimes even if the blow misses 
                    altogether!). 
                </p>
                <p>There are 400-plus species of mantis shrimp. Some, known as "spearers", have front legs 
                    topped with spear-like barbs with which they stab or snag soft-bellied prey, such as fish.
                    Others, like the peacock mantis shrimp, are "smashers", equipped with hammer-like clubs
                    that they use to batter and bludgeon shellfish and crustaceans.

                <h3>Structure of the Punch</h3>
                <img src="https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/800px-Aedes_aegypti_free.jpg" alt="Mantis shrimp body's frontal image.">
                <p>
                    How can this animal repeatedly deliver powerful blows without damaging itself in the 
                    process? The answer lies in the clubs’ complex structure. Lying beneath their thick 
                    outer "impact region" at the front is a composite of chitin fibres (a material that 
                    also makes up most of its shell). Stacked in helical layers resembling a spiral 
                    staircase, these act as shock absorbers, preventing any cracks from spreading through 
                    the club. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Researchers are now looking at ways in which the same principles could be applied to 
                    body armour, automobile frames and sports helmets.
